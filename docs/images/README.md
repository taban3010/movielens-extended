# Algorithm Visualization Images

This directory contains diagrams illustrating the different recommendation algorithms:

- `user_based_cf.png` - User-based collaborative filtering diagram
- `item_based_cf.png` - Item-based collaborative filtering diagram  
- `matrix_factorization.png` - Matrix factorization algorithm diagram

These images are referenced in the main README.md to explain how each algorithm works.

Note: In a real implementation, these would be actual algorithm diagrams. For this demo, they serve as placeholders to show where visual explanations would go in the documentation.
